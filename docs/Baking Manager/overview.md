# Baking Manager

The **Baking Manager** tool was initialy created to help artists organise their **Low** and **High** poly objects in Maya to create baking groups and speed up the process of organizing their scenes for baking.  

Baking groups are created by matching the name of the high and low poly meshes and islotating them. This fuctionality avoids geometry bleeding over each other during the baking process to achieve clean textures. It avoids having to move away meshes (often referred as "exploding") to achieve the same result. 

^^Documentation on baking:^^  [Substance link](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-bake/features/matching-by-name.html "Go to Substance Painter documentation for baking with Matching by name.") //
[Marmoset link](https://marmoset.co/posts/toolbag-baking-tutorial/ "Go to Marmoset documentation for baking with Matching by name.").

The tool has since evolved to accomodate the needs of artists and help organize their scenes.
